# Agents guide

## Ask the user when unsure

Your task is to faithfully do as the user tell you to. This means that if the user is unclear or confused about something, you need to clarify, rather than attempt to be creative and "guess".

## Async combinators

Avoid tokio macros for async combinators. Prefer function-based combinators from crates like futures-concurrency.

## Calling async from sync

Strongly prefer pollster's `block_on()` unless you have a good reason to use, say, the tokio specific block_on.

## Blocking in egui

When in egui, it's actually *fine* to block on the render thread on an RPC call using `.block_on()` from pollster, **as long as the call never touches the network or otherwise takes an unbounded amount of time**. And most InternalProtocol RPC calls do not touch the network, but merely load data from a small SQLite database that is almost certainly already in the page cache.

This is doubly so if the RPC call is in a `use_memo` or any other construct that avoids calling it every single render.

## egui_hooks use_state

`use_state` is already keyed by the current `ui.id()` and hook index. The `deps` argument only forces re-initialization *within the same widget id* when it changes. In most cases, pass `()` for deps. Only use deps when you explicitly want to reset state within a single widget instance. For distinct state scopes, prefer `ui.push_id(...)` or `use_hook_as(...)` rather than encoding IDs into deps.

## Docs maintenance

Keep `docs/SUMMARY.md` in sync with the docs. When adding, removing, or renaming doc pages, update the summary accordingly.

## Documentation rules

- Keep docs implementation-neutral; do not mention Rust type names.
- When referring to other doc files, use Markdown links (e.g. `[events](events.md)`).
- When describing BCS-encoded structures, use tuple/list notation (e.g. `[a, b, c]`), since field names are not preserved.
- When documenting flows, prefer clear pseudocode that enables clean-room implementations.

## cargo check

Always run cargo check after making significant changes to make sure things compile.
