# Events

An event is the plaintext payload carried inside encrypted messages. It is BCS-encoded as a tuple:

```
[recipient, sent_at, mime, body]
```

- `recipient`: either a username (for DMs) or a group ID (for group chats)
- `sent_at`: a timestamp
- `mime`: a MIME type string
- `body`: opaque bytes

The `mime` field indicates how to interpret `body`. For human chat messages, `body` is usually the raw bytes of the text. For structured messages (like group invites or group management commands), `body` is typically JSON and the MIME value identifies the schema.

## Supported MIME types

| MIME type | Description | Body encoding | Recipient |

| `text/markdown` | Human chat message with Markdown | Raw UTF-8 text bytes | Username or group ID |

| `application/vnd.nullspace.v1.group_manage` | Group management command | JSON | Group ID |
