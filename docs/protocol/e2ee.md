# End-to-end encryption

The Signal Protocol (formerly known as Axolotl) and variations on it is the de facto standard for end-to-end encrypted messaging. Software using it includes Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Matrix (through its Olm and Megolm variations), Google Messages...

But Nullspace intentionally uses an E2EE scheme *very different from Signal Protocol*. We systematically avoid the "key ratcheting" design of Signal Protocol, trading off certain security features that make sense only in certain edge cases, and return get a simpler protocol, easier implementation, and *much* better performance in scenarios such as extremely large groups.

This is to achieve a key design goal of Nullspace --- **making encrypted chat UX just as good as traditional chat UX**.

## Nullspace's "contrarian" cryptography

The two major differences in Nullspace's E2EE security model and that of Signal Protocol are actually that we *don't* have two properties that Signal does have:
- **Deniability**: users cannot prove to a third party [give a definition]
- **Fine-grained forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise secrecy**: [give a definition]

### On deniability

There is some level of debate on this (when has cryptographic signatures on chat transcripts ever made a difference in court?), but deniability is probably a desirable feature. All else being equal, a protocol with deniability is probably more secure than a protocol without, in the sense that deniability protects more things users care about than non-repudiation in most situations users find themselves.

The problem is that all else is not equal. We must pay very large costs to achieve deniability, costs that prevent a chat system from achieving the same feature set and performance as a non-e2ee system.

First of all, *deniability complicates protocol design* and is effectively impossible for large groups. Each message's authenticity must be verifiable by an unbounded number of counterparties, so triple-DH-style implicit authentication isn't going to work. Trying to sorta scale deniability to groups means more complex cryptographic machinery, like Signal's Sender Keys system, which requires every user joining a group to contact every other group member to distribute a per-group signing key over the 1-on-1 deniable channel. This still doesn't really work for large groups --- in practice Signal limits groups to 1000 members.

(And even then, and it still doesn't get us the same amount of deniability that 1-on-1 Signal chats have. This is a long story, but it's essentially because we're still binding messages to the same group-level pseudonym in a non-repudiable fashion. MLS, the complex standard-track protocol whose entire ambition is to scale Signal Protocol features to huge groups, also gives up on scaling deniability. Why so is also somewhat of a long story, but I suspect that deniability is at a really fundamental level impossible to scale to large groups.)

So the best we can do is have DMs be deniable, but groups be on a spectrum from not-deniable to sorta-deniable. But that brings us to the second point: *varying deniability between groups and DMs is really bad UX*. Users will be surprised if group chat transcripts can't be faked, but people can fake chat transcripts in DMs. "Can I ask for cryptographic proof for this scandalous Nullspace convo going viral" should have a uniform answer either way.

Finally, in practice, deniability minimally affects the most problematic forms of non-repudiation that it defends against in theory, while actually disabling some some *more user-empowering* forms of non-repudiation. 

Powerful third parties have really good ways of getting proof that somebody said something, like subpoenaing server logs and confiscating devices, that don't require cryptographic non-repudiation. Put it another way, deniable systems don't prevent providers from offering non-repudiable "abuse report" features, i.e. users snitching each other out to the server (a unique server-side ID of the message and a copy of the unique symmetric key used to encrypt that message is enough to prove to the server that somebody said something). 

On the other hand, deniability means that we cannot offer certain features securely, like quote-forwarding messages purporting to be from other users. If forging "message quotes" is done by server-side logic or some other non-cryptogrpahic mechanism, then it's even worse, since malicious servers can easily fool users who are accustomed to trusting the "original author" field displayed in the UI.

### On compromise blast radii

- **We use periodic rekeying rather than ratcheting**. Yes, this does mean we give up message-level FS/PCS.
    - Real-world compromise blast radii are *far* bigger than compromising a single key. There just isn't a realistic scenario where 1. all the keys on a device get compromised 2. no previous message history gets compromised 3. the attacker can't impersonate the user to download more messages, participate in further ratcheting, etc, at least for a small amount of time. 
    - This means that a *cryptographic* compromise blast radius of smaller than a few hours is unlikely to improve security. Message-granularity FS/PCS is way overkill. Periodic rekeying is a perfectly reasonable way of getting coarse-grained FS/PCS, where compromising all keys on a device allows decrypting messages within a few hours in the future and the past, but nothing further.
    - In return, we get totally game-changing implementation and performance benefits:
        - Huge group sizes are possible. "Discord server"-sized communites that are entirely E2EE are now realistic.
        - Client implementations are far less complex and stateful. Signal and WhatsApp are probably the only Signal Protocol implementations that don't occasionally glitch out with "decryption failed".
        - Client correctness no longer relies on atomically durable storage, restoring devices from old backups no longer cause catastrophic failures, ...

## Basic primitives

Before we discuss the specific protocols, it's useful to outline a few primitives.

### Events

An event is the plaintext payload carried inside encrypted messages. It is BCS-encoded as:

```
[recipient, sent_at, mime, body]
```

- `recipient`: `["user", username]` (for DMs) or `["group", group_id]` (for group chats)
- `sent_at`: Unix timestamp (nanoseconds)
- `mime`: a MIME type string
- `body`: opaque bytes

### Tagged blobs

Many places in the protocol carry opaque, tagged payloads as a **tagged blob**:

```
[kind, inner]
```

- `kind`: a string tag like `v1.message_content` or `v1.group_message`
- `inner`: raw bytes whose interpretation depends on `kind`

Tagged blobs are BCS-encoded.

### Header encryption

Header encryption encrypts a message such that any member of a group of devices, each with their own Diffie-Hellman keypair, can decrypt it. For reasons that will be clear later, the keys that these devices hold are known as the **medium-term keys** of the devices.

Header encryption, by itself, provides no authentication of the sender or contents whatsoever. It's insecure used by itself!

Structure:
- A header-encrypted message is a BCS-encoded tuple `[sender_epk, headers, body]`.
- `sender_epk` is a fresh ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public key generated per message.
- `headers` is a list of per-recipient entries. Each entry carries an index hint derived from the recipient's medium-term public key, plus an encrypted copy of a fresh per-message AEAD key.
- `body` is the message ciphertext encrypted under that per-message AEAD key, with AAD that commits to `sender_epk` and `headers`.

In pseudocode:

```
header_encrypt(recipients_mpk[], plaintext_bytes):
    sender_esk = x25519_random_secret()
    sender_epk = x25519_public(sender_esk)
    k = random_bytes(32)  // per-message AEAD key

    headers = []
    for receiver_mpk in recipients_mpk:
        receiver_mpk_short = h(bcs_encode(receiver_mpk))[0..2]
        ss = x25519_dh(sender_esk, receiver_mpk)
        receiver_key = xchacha20_encrypt(key=ss, nonce=0, plaintext=k)  // stream cipher, no auth
        headers += [receiver_mpk_short, receiver_key]

    aad = bcs_encode([sender_epk, headers])
    body = xchacha20_poly1305_encrypt(key=k, nonce=0, aad=aad, plaintext=plaintext_bytes)
    return bcs_encode([sender_epk, headers, body])

header_decrypt(my_msk, header_encrypted_bytes):
    [sender_epk, headers, body] = bcs_decode(header_encrypted_bytes)
    my_mpk_short = h(bcs_encode(x25519_public(my_msk)))[0..2]
    ss = x25519_dh(my_msk, sender_epk)
    aad = bcs_encode([sender_epk, headers])

    for header in headers where header.receiver_mpk_short == my_mpk_short:
        k = xchacha20_decrypt(key=ss, nonce=0, ciphertext=header.receiver_key)
        if xchacha20_poly1305_decrypt(key=k, nonce=0, aad=aad, ciphertext=body) succeeds:
            return plaintext_bytes

    fail
```

Notes:
- `h(...)` is BLAKE3.
- The 2-byte `receiver_mpk_short` is only an index hint and may collide; the decryptor tries all matching candidates.
- Nonce `0` is safe here because both `ss` and `k` are per-message fresh.

### Device signing

Device signing signs an arbitrary message in such a way that proves that it's signed by a device belonging to a particular username, as long as the recipient has access to directory lookups for that username. This is useful to allow recipients to avoid fetching device lists from "foreign" servers in order to decrypt messages, only to encrypt them.

Structure:
- A device-signed message is a BCS-encoded tuple `[sender, cert_chain, body, signature]`.
- `sender` and `cert_chain` identify which device is doing the signing, and allow recipients to validate that the device belongs to `sender` via directory verification.
- `body` is opaque bytes; recipients interpret it according to the context where device signing is used.
- `signature` authenticates the tuple `(sender, cert_chain, body)`.

In pseudocode:

```
device_sign(sender_username, sender_cert_chain, sender_device_signing_sk, body_bytes):
    payload = [sender_username, sender_cert_chain, body_bytes]
    signature = ed25519_sign(sender_device_signing_sk, bcs_encode(payload))
    return bcs_encode([sender_username, sender_cert_chain, body_bytes, signature])

device_verify(device_signed_bytes, trusted_root_hash):
    [sender, cert_chain, body, signature] = bcs_decode(device_signed_bytes)
    verify_certificate_chain(cert_chain, trusted_root_hash)  // see [devices.md](devices.md)
    sender_device_pk = cert_chain.leaf_device_public_key
    ed25519_verify(sender_device_pk, signature, bcs_encode([sender, cert_chain, body]))
    return (sender, body)
```

The signature is over the full tuple `(sender, cert_chain, body)` rather than just `body` as defense-in-depth against malleability.

## DM encryption

If Alice wants to send a plaintext [event](events.md) as a DM to Bob:

- A DM is sent as a mailbox entry whose `kind` is `v1.direct_message`.
- The mailbox `body` is a header-encrypted payload (see "Header encryption").
- The header-encrypted plaintext is a device-signed payload (see "Device signing").
- The device-signed `body` is a tagged blob whose `kind` is `v1.message_content`, and whose `inner` is a BCS-encoded [event](events.md).

```
send_dm(to_username, event):
    event_bytes = bcs_encode(event)
    msg_blob_bytes = bcs_encode(["v1.message_content", event_bytes])
    signed_bytes = device_sign(my_username, my_cert_chain, my_device_signing_sk, msg_blob_bytes)
    recipients_mpk = fetch_all_medium_public_keys(to_username)
    he_bytes = header_encrypt(recipients_mpk, signed_bytes)
    mailbox_send(mailbox=direct_mailbox(to_username), kind="v1.direct_message", body=he_bytes)
```

On receive, Bob does:

```
recv_dm(he_bytes):
    signed_bytes = header_decrypt(my_medium_sk_current, he_bytes)
        or header_decrypt(my_medium_sk_previous, he_bytes)
    (sender_username, msg_blob_bytes) = device_verify(signed_bytes, directory_root_hash(sender_username))
    [kind, inner] = bcs_decode(msg_blob_bytes)
    assert kind == "v1.message_content"
    event = bcs_decode(inner)
    return event
```

Each participant periodically refreshes their medium-term keys, at an interval *not more frequent than* once every hour (so that caching lookups for 1 hour is always safe). Participants also keep around their previous medium-term key to decrypt any out-of-order messages.

This ensures FS/PCS within 2 hours.

## Group encryption

Group messages are encrypted with a symmetric group key shared by all active members. The exact group message format and the group management semantics are specified in [groups.md](groups.md).

### Group rekeys

- A group rekey is sent as a mailbox entry whose `kind` is `v1.group_rekey`.
- The mailbox `body` is a header-encrypted payload (see "Header encryption").
- The header-encrypted plaintext is a device-signed payload (see "Device signing").
- The device-signed `body` is a BCS-encoded tuple `[group_id, new_group_key_bytes]`.

Group rekeys are distributed with header encryption:

```
send_group_rekey(group_id, new_group_key_bytes):
    payload_bytes = bcs_encode([group_id, new_group_key_bytes])
    signed_bytes = device_sign(my_username, my_cert_chain, my_device_signing_sk, payload_bytes)
    recipients_mpk = fetch_all_medium_public_keys_of_active_members(group_id)
    he_bytes = header_encrypt(recipients_mpk, signed_bytes)
    mailbox_send(mailbox=group_messages_mailbox(group_id), kind="v1.group_rekey", body=he_bytes)
```

Group membership, invites, bans, admins, and management messages are specified in [groups.md](groups.md). Ultimately, these messages make sure everybody has the same understanding of the **roster** (who's in the group and who has what permissions), which is important for rekeys to be decryptable by the correct set of participants.
